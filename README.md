# Marketing Analytics in Python
Projects under a Marketing Analytics course written in python notebooks

## 1. Basic Data Analytics 
- Basic implementation of fundamental data analysis libraries such as pandas.
- Making simple descriptions for advertising data


## 2. Visuals for Marketers 
### Advertising data
- Frequency table visualized with bar plot
### Marriages and Divorce data 
- Line plots to visuals the trend over the years
- Bar charts to compare marriages and divorces per capita for specific years (1900,1950,2000)
### Hollywood actors data 
- Horizontal bar chart to show which actors have the most "kills" on cinema
### Recent college graduates earnings 
- Manipulate the data to find which majors are male dominated and which are female dominated
- With Box plots we compare the earnings in Male-dominated vs Female-dominated majors
- With a histogram we show the distribution of earnings
- With bar plots we compare the average earnings between engineering and business school, for majors that are primarily composed of men versus women.

## 3. Nissan Infiniti G20 Case study
Car manufacture Nissan planned to introduce the Infiniti G20 in the United States market, adding a third model to the existing Infiniti product line. Nissan's Infiniti division conducted a survey in its target segment to access the attidutes of consumers towards different brands and car models in the market. They surveyed each consumer and average their response to obtain a table with columns being each car model, and rows represnting each car attribute.

We simulate a situation where we help the manager in the Infiniti division to interpret the information in the survey that is not directly readable.
- Correlational analysis, heatmaps
We also provide him with a perceptual map that characterize model G20's position in the market relative to its competitors.
- Factor analysis and Interpretations
- Visualizing the perceptual maps over 3 graphs
